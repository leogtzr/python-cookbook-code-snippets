Python also supports the normalization forms NFKC and NFKD, which add extra compatibility features for 
dealing with certain kinds of characters. For example:

>>> s = '\ufb01'   # A single character
>>> s
'ﬁ'
>>> unicodedata.normalize('NFD', s)
'ﬁ'

# Notice how the combined letters are broken apart here
>>> unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', s)
'fi'
>>> unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', s)
'fi'
>>>
