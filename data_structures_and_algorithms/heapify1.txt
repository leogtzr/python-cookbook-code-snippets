The most important feature of a heap is that heap[0] is always the smallest item. 
Moreover, subsequent items can be easily found using the heapq.heappop() method, 
which pops off the first item and replaces it with the next smallest 
item (an operation that requires O(log N) operations where N is the size of the heap). 
For example, to find the three smallest items, you would do this:

>>> heapq.heappop(heap)
-4
>>> heapq.heappop(heap)
1
>>> heapq.heappop(heap)
2

The nlargest() and nsmallest() functions are most appropriate if you are 
trying to find a relatively small number of items. If you are simply trying to 
find the single smallest or largest item (N=1)
