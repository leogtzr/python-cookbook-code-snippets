The solution involving zip() solves the problem by “inverting” the dictionary into 
a sequence of (value, key) pairs. When performing comparisons on such tuples, 
the value element is compared first, followed by the key. 
This gives you exactly the behavior that you want and allows reductions and sorting to be easily performed on the dictionary contents using a single statement.
